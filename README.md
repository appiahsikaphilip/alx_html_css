This project is part of the *ALX Front-End Curriculum*, following the *HTML, Advanced project*.  
In this stage, we focus on CSS styling and visual design implementation based on a Figma mockup.


## Objectives

The main goals of this project are to:
- Apply *ADVANCED CSS* concepts to style an existing HTML structure.
- Recreate the layout and design from the FIGMA FILE provided.
- Use proper typography, colors, alignment, and responsive layout techniques.
- Maintain semantic HTML and clean structure.
