# Headphones Landing Page 🎧

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **ALX HTML & CSS curriculum**.  
It focuses on creating a **responsive landing page** based on a **Figma design**.  

At this stage, the project is **prepared for implementation** with the proper folder structure and placeholder files.

## Project Objectives

- Understand and navigate a **Figma design file**  
- Duplicate the project in Figma to access all design details  
- Prepare project structure with **HTML, CSS, and README**  
- Ensure **responsiveness and interaction notes** are considered for later implementation

## Figma Design Notes

- Font families: **Source Sans Pro** and **Spin Cycle OT**  
- Floating-point values in the design may be **rounded**  
- Desktop max width: **1000px**  
- Mobile version triggers at **480px or less**  
- Interactions:
  - Links hover/active: `#FF6565`
